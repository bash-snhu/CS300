## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem presented in the projects for this course was the selection of data structures based on the application or problem to be solved. We were given a scenario where we were asked to create a solution based on a client's problem.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by first trying to understand the requirements of the solution to the best of my ability. The client needed to read data into a data structure from a source that was mostly sorted, and then would need to be sorted with no insertions after the fact (except when sorting). Additionally, the ID they would be sorted by had similar endings, which would mean high collisions for a hash table. I was worried using a vector structure would be seen as taking the easy way out, but I genuinely believe it is the most straightforward and non-overcomplicated solution.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I had difficulty with some activities, trying to incorporate each data structure into the bid and node classes used in the activities. I think that is mostly that I haven't used C++ OOP a lot, but I think that will get better with more experience.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The simplest route isn't always the best, and there are a lot of options out there that aren't baked into the popular programming languages. It's very important, especially when dealing with a lot of data, to choose a data structue that is appropriate and efficient in its application. In my googling I found that data structure efficiency can scale a lot depending on number of inputs, and that a data structure can be inefficient with too few data points. That was interesting to find.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
